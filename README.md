### An over-engineered to-do list app

 For this project, I aim to create a complete working example of a production-ready full-stack application. To prioritize functionality of the app, I am replicating Todoist's user interface instead of creating my own custom design. I really like their sleek aesthetic and the idea of creating/styling a Todoist UI clone has been in my plans for a while. 

##### Roadmap 

The app is a basic to-do list CRUD application that should have the following features:

 - [x] Todoist UI Clone (frontend)
 - [x] Sign up and log in screens frontend
 - [x] Authentication backend
 - [ ] Authenticated users can add, complete, uncomplete, modify, and delete tasks
 - [ ] Users can drag tasks to rearrange them
 - [ ] Users can add due dates to tasks
 - [ ] Users can schedule email reminders
 - [ ] Users can choose the priority for each task
 - [ ] Users can break tasks into subtasks
 - [ ] Users can set up projects with multiple tasks
 - [ ] Users can invite multiple team members to projects
 - [ ] Multiple team members can have discussion in task's comments
 - [ ] Projects can be shareable
 - [ ] Allow integration to other project management tools
